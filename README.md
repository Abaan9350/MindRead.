A Python Program for my semester four mini project in which. the user can think of a random classmate and my programme will be correctly able to guess what the user is thinking about. The user will be asked a certain number of patients and he has to reply with yes or no. This is exactly just like Akinator, but I did this customised for my own class.
Adding few students every day consistently.
